#This will overview of Hashing

 "Thus However, hashing is not useful for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, as the only information given on a failed search is that the hash valued is not present in any record. Binary search is more ideal for this such."


#Binary Search 

 "Binary Search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the hash valued cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the hashed value, and repeating this until the hash value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the hash is not in the array."


#Parallel Bulk 

 "This approach can be applied to every sorted sequence data structure that supports efficient join- and split-operations."
